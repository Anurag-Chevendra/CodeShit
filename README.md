# CodeShit
A college lending and borrowing website
(php-html-css-js)

## *Setting up the environment...*
This project requires a local host, i've used XAMPP because it has an inbuilt SQL module.


The "XAMPP" file changes are not necessary unless you want to send emails via php. 

sendmail.init path : "C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.init";
php.init path : "C:\xampp\php\php.init"

you need to enter your email and it's password in these files.

i suggest restarting XAMPP once the above changes have been made. 

Save your code in "XAMPP\htdocs" folder.
